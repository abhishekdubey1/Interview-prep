   **What is Callback Hell in JavaScript?**

   <details>
   <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
   <p>
   Callback Hell, also known as Pyramid of Doom, refers to the situation in JavaScript programming where multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations. This can lead to deeply nested and hard-to-read code, making it difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.

   **Explain Why Callback Hell Occurs in JavaScript Code.**

   <details>
   <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
   <p>
   Callback Hell occurs in JavaScript code when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, reading files, or making database queries. When multiple asynchronous tasks are dependent on each other or need to be executed sequentially, developers often resort to nesting callbacks, leading to deeply nested code structures.

   **What are the Drawbacks of Callback Hell in JavaScript Development?**

   <details>
   <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
   <p>
   - Readability: Callback Hell can result in code that is difficult to read and understand due to its deeply nested nature.
   - Maintainability: Code with numerous nested callbacks can be challenging to maintain and modify, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
   - Error Handling: Error handling becomes more complex in Callback Hell, as it can be challenging to track the flow of execution and handle errors effectively.
   - Debugging: Debugging nested callback code can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when trying to trace the source of errors or unexpected behavior.

   **What are Some Strategies to Avoid Callback Hell in JavaScript?**

   <details>
   <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
   <p>
   - Modularization: Break down complex tasks into smaller, modular functions that can be reused and composed.
   - Promises: Use Promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and sequential manner, avoiding excessive nesting.
   - Async/Await: Use Async/Await syntax, which provides a more concise and readable way to work with asynchronous code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous tasks.
   - Library/Module Usage: Utilize libraries or modules that provide control flow mechanisms or abstractions for handling asynchronous operations, such as async.js or RxJS.

   **Can you Describe an Example of Callback Hell and How it Can be Refactored?**

   <details>
   <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
   <p>
   Example of Callback Hell:
   ```javascript
   asyncTask1(function(result1) {
     asyncTask2(result1, function(result2) {
       asyncTask3(result2, function(result3) {
         // More nested callbacks...
       });
     });
   });
   ```

   Refactored Example using Promises:
   ```javascript
   asyncTask1()
     .then(result1 => asyncTask2(result1))
     .then(result2 => asyncTask3(result2))
     .then(result3 => {
       // Code after all async tasks are completed
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Error handling
     });
   ```
